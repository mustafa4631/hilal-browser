## Claude-Specific Notes

- When the user asks you to work on Hilal Browser, you are working on **this overlay repo**, not on Firefox upstream. The `engine/` directory is a gitignored checkout where you edit and build, but commits happen in the root repo.
- Always run `./bin/hil refresh` after editing in `engine/` before telling the user changes are ready. Do not leave edits only in the gitignored tree.
- When regenerating patches, review `git diff` output to ensure the patch is focused and doesn't include unrelated changes.
- If the user asks about a Firefox API or internal module, use `searchfox-cli` before guessing or grepping blindly.
