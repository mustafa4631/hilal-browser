# Building Hilal Browser on macOS

This is a short addendum to Mozilla's official guide:
<https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/macos_build.html>

If you haven't done it yet, bootstrap your machine **once**:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla-firefox/firefox/refs/heads/main/python/mozboot/bin/bootstrap.py -O
python3 bootstrap.py
```

That installs Xcode CLT, the build sysroot, `mozbuild`/`mach`
dependencies, `cargo`, and `cbindgen`. It only needs to run once per
machine.

## Building Hilal

From the repo root:

```bash
# One-time: fetch Firefox into ./engine
./bin/hil setup

# Apply patches + branding overlays
./bin/hil apply

# Full build (10-40 minutes on first run)
scripts/build-macos.sh

# Run
(cd engine && ./mach run)
```

## Faster iteration

| Change kind | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Front-end only (JS, HTML, CSS, XHTML, FTL, .ini) | `scripts/build-macos.sh faster` |
| C++ / Rust only | `scripts/build-macos.sh binaries` |
| Mixed | `scripts/build-macos.sh` (full) |

These map directly to `./mach build faster` / `./mach build binaries`
and are documented at <https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/build/buildsystem/buildfaster.html>.

## Where does the built app live?

After a successful build, the macOS app bundle is at:

```
firefox/obj-aarch64-apple-darwin*/dist/Hilal Browser.app
```

The bundle name comes from `changes/browser/branding/hilal/configure.sh`, which sets
`MOZ_APP_DISPLAYNAME` to `Hilal Browser`. The CFBundleIdentifier reflects
our distribution id (`org.hilal`) thanks to the patch in
`changes/browser/branding-defaults.patch`.

## Code signing and notarization

Local development builds are unsigned. macOS Gatekeeper may complain
the first time you launch from Finder; right-click → Open works around
it, or run via `./mach run`.

Do not upload unsigned local DMGs as public release assets. Downloaded macOS
apps are subject to Gatekeeper quarantine, and a normal double-click launch for
users requires a Developer ID signed and notarized app. The Apple Developer
Program is therefore required for public macOS releases; without it, the only
honest distribution is an explicitly unsigned development build with manual
Gatekeeper workaround instructions.

For distribution builds, use `scripts/sign-macos.sh` after packaging.

### Prerequisites

1. Enroll in the Apple Developer Program.
2. Create a **Developer ID Application** certificate in Apple Developer
   Portal and install it in your local Keychain.
3. Generate an **app-specific password** for notarization.
4. Note your **Apple Team ID**.

### Sign only (local testing)

```bash
export CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
scripts/build-macos.sh package
scripts/sign-macos.sh
```

### Sign + notarize + staple (release)

```bash
export CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
export APPLE_ID="you@example.com"
export APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD="xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
export APPLE_TEAM_ID="TEAMID"

scripts/build-macos.sh package
scripts/sign-macos.sh --notarize
```

### Verify a signed bundle

```bash
scripts/sign-macos.sh --verify-only
```

Or manually:

```bash
codesign --verify --deep --strict "engine/obj-*/dist/Hilal Browser.app"
spctl -a -t exec -vv "engine/obj-*/dist/Hilal Browser.app"
```

### CI secrets

Do not commit certificates or passwords. In GitHub Actions, add these
as repository secrets:

| Secret | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` | Developer ID Application identity string |
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple ID email |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | App-specific password |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Apple Team ID |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE` | Base64-encoded `.p12` certificate (optional, for CI keychain import) |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for the `.p12` (optional) |

See `.github/workflows/release.yml` for the optional CI signing job.

## Common issues

**`mozconfig` not found / weird defaults.** `./mach` doesn't require a
`mozconfig`. If you want one, drop it inside `engine/` (gitignored by
its own tree). Don't add it here.

**Object directory mismatch.** Different macOS arches use different
`obj-*` paths. `./mach` picks correctly; if you've swapped Macs, run
`./mach clobber` inside `engine/`.

**Bootstrap re-runs.** If `./mach build` complains about a missing
`bootstrap`ed tool, rerun `./mach bootstrap` (this is the in-tree
helper, distinct from the one-time `bootstrap.py` above).

**Big rebuilds after `./bin/hil apply --force`.** Force-apply resets
the tree, which usually invalidates the build cache. Expect a slow next
build.
