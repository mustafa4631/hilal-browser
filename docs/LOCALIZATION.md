# Localization Workflow

Hilal follows the operating system language when a matching bundled locale is
installed. If no installed locale matches the system language, Firefox's locale
negotiation falls back to the packaged `en-US` locale.

The default is controlled by:

```js
pref("intl.locale.requested", "");
```

## Adding a New Language

To integrate a new language pack (e.g., Turkish `tr`):

1. **Initialize the official Firefox locale files**:
   Run the setup script to fetch the official translations from Mozilla's l10n repository and copy them into your local workspace:
   ```bash
   scripts/setup-locales.sh
   ```
   This will initialize `engine/browser/locales/<locale>/` and run the locale merger script.

2. **Add Hilal-specific Fluent translations**:
   Add custom translation files under:
   ```text
   changes/browser/locales/<locale>/browser/
   ```
   This directory mirrors the localization layout in Firefox under `browser/localization/<locale>/browser/`. For example:
   ```text
   changes/browser/locales/tr/browser/browser.ftl
   changes/browser/locales/tr/browser/sidebar.ftl
   changes/browser/locales/tr/browser/preferences/preferences.ftl
   ```

3. **Apply patches and merge translations**:
   Run the patch manager to apply all workspace configurations and merge the custom translations from `changes/browser/locales/` into the `engine/`:
   ```bash
   ./bin/hil apply
   ```

4. **Compile the language pack (`.xpi`)**:
   Run the langpack compilation script to build the language pack and copy the generated `.xpi` file to the distribution extension directory:
   ```bash
   scripts/build-langpacks.sh
   ```
   This will compile the locale files inside `engine/` and place the finished package in `changes/browser/app/distribution/extensions/langpack-<locale>@firefox.mozilla.org.xpi` (which you should also commit to version control).

5. **Build the browser**:
   Build or package the browser normally using the platform build scripts (e.g., `scripts/build-macos.sh`).

## Notes

- Brand strings are not translated. Each bundled langpack receives the Hilal
  brand values from `changes/browser/branding/hilal/locales/en-US/`.
- Keep Hilal-specific strings in matching files across locales where practical.
- Missing translations can fall back to English, but complete locale overlays
  avoid noisy Fluent missing-message logs.
- `browser/app/distribution/moz.build` (patched by `changes/browser/ublock.patch`) includes bundled langpacks with a wildcard, so new language packs do not need a manual `moz.build` edit.

## User Language Selection Settings

The interface language can be set explicitly by the user in **Settings → Hilal Preferences → Language Selection**:
1. Choosing **System Language (Default)** sets `intl.locale.requested` to `""`, falling back to the OS system language negotiation.
2. Selecting a specific language sets `intl.locale.requested` to that locale code (e.g., `"tr"`).
3. The available options in the dropdown are fetched dynamically from the bundled language packs, with a static fallback to `["en-US", "tr"]` if dynamic detection fails.
4. When a new language is applied, the user is prompted to restart the browser to apply the settings.
