## Core Features

*   **Gecko Engine Power**: Built on top of Firefox Quantum, providing standard add-on compatibility, memory safety, and top-tier web standards compliance.
*   **uBlock Origin Integrated**: Intrusive advertisements, tracking cookies, and telemetry popups are blocked by default for a clean, fast experience.
*   **Vertical Collapsible Tabs**: Reclaims vertical reading space on widescreen displays via a collapsible sidebar hierarchical list.
*   **Translucent Glass Interface**: Premium glassmorphic styles that harmonize with macOS native transparent and vibrant window boundaries.
*   **Sovereign Privacy**: No user profiling, no tracking telemetry, no remote storage, 100 percent open source and transparent.

## Project History

Hilal Browser is the continuation of the project previously developed as **Huma Browser**. The project has now been officially restarted and reintroduced under the **Hilal Browser** name, with the current repository, branding, defaults, and documentation reflecting that new identity.

This repository is **not** a fork of the Firefox source code — it is a small **patch and overlay layer** on top of upstream [mozilla-firefox/firefox](https://github.com/mozilla-firefox/firefox). We stay as close to upstream as possible so we can keep rebasing forward forever.

---

## Workspace Layout

Everything Hilal-specific lives in this repository:

| Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `patches/` | Numbered, focused `.patch` files (unified diffs) applied to Firefox in `series` order. |
| `branding/` | Branding overlays. Subdirectories are copied to `browser/branding/<name>/` in Firefox. |
| `prefs/` | Optional preference / configuration overlays mirroring the Firefox directory structure. |
| `scripts/` | Workflow automation scripts for setup, apply, refresh, upstream sync, and builds. |
| `docs/` | Workflow and build documentation. |

---

## Quick Start (macOS)

```bash
# 1. Complete Mozilla's one-time macOS setup:
#    https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/macos_build.html

# 2. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/VastSea0/hilal-browser.git
cd hilal-browser

# 3. Clone Firefox into ./firefox (gitignored)
scripts/setup-firefox.sh

# 4. Apply all Hilal patches and overlays
scripts/apply.sh

# 5. Build (delegates to ./mach build inside ./firefox)
scripts/build-macos.sh

# 6. Run the browser
(cd firefox && ./mach run)
```

The Firefox source tree under `./firefox/` is **gitignored** inside this repository to prevent accidental commits of upstream files.

## The Five Core Operations

| Goal | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Get a Firefox checkout next to this repo | `scripts/setup-firefox.sh` |
| Apply every Hilal patch + overlay onto Firefox | `scripts/apply.sh` |
| Regenerate patches from changes you made in `./firefox` | `scripts/refresh.sh` |
| Pull upstream Firefox and rebase Hilal on top | `scripts/sync-upstream.sh` |
| Build on macOS | `scripts/build-macos.sh` |

All scripts accept `-h` for usage. See `docs/WORKFLOW.md` for the full developer flow.

## Layering Mechanics

### Patches
`patches/series` lists `.patch` files in the order they should be
applied. Each file is a plain unified diff (compatible with `git apply`
and `patch -p1`). `scripts/apply.sh` walks the series, skipping any
patch that's already in the tree.

Keep patches **small, focused, and one-purpose**. One feature per
patch, one bugfix per patch — same conventions that make a clean
Phabricator review.

### Branding & prefs overlays
Binary assets (icons, splash screens, etc.) make terrible patches.
Instead, anything under `branding/<name>/` is `rsync`'d directly into
`browser/branding/<name>/`. Anything under `prefs/` is copied to the
matching path in the Firefox tree. This keeps `patches/` text-only and
reviewable.

### Source tree layout
```
hilal-browser/              <- this repo
├── branding/hilal/         <- assets, mirrored into firefox/browser/branding/hilal/
├── patches/series         <- order of patch application
├── patches/*.patch        <- focused source-code patches
├── prefs/                 <- optional pref / config overlays
├── scripts/               <- workflow helpers
├── docs/                  <- detailed docs
└── firefox/               <- (gitignored) full Firefox checkout
```
