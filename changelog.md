## [0.2.0-alpha.4] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- **Workspace-Specific Bookmark Folders**: Each workspace now has a dedicated bookmark folder for context-isolated bookmarking, with URL filtering tied to the active workspace.
- **Bang Customization UI**: Added a Bangs settings panel in Hilal Preferences for default bangs and custom trigger, search URL, and home URL entries.
- **Bang Fallback**: Routed unknown bangs to DuckDuckGo's bang handler (`https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!bang+query`).
- **Dynamic Sidebar Shortcut Favicons**: Custom sidebar shortcuts now display favicons fetched from Firefox's `page-icon:` cache instead of performing a live web request, preserving privacy.
- **Full Localization of Preferences and Welcome Screen**: All hardcoded label strings in the preferences panel and welcome screen have been replaced with Fluent `data-l10n-id` bindings and new FTL definitions.

### Changed
- **Firefox Upstream Sync**: Updated the Firefox base to version `153.0a1` (upstream commit `f596fa5fe90d`).
- **Patch Apply Checksum Validation**: `scripts/apply.sh` now computes a content hash of the entire patch series and skips re-applying patches if nothing has changed, speeding up incremental builds.
- **Hilal Preferences UI Reorganization**: Sidebar, workspace, privacy, and UI fix preference modules have been refactored into separate, focused blocks within `hilal.inc.xhtml`.

### Fixed
- **Workspace Tab Operations in Customization Mode**: Prevented workspace tab move/retarget operations from running while the browser is in sidebar customization mode, which could corrupt tab state.
- **Patch Apply Conflicts**: Fixed a line-offset conflict in `0016-hilal-bang-customization.patch` caused by duplicate Fluent string definitions already introduced by `0005-hilal-l10n.patch`.
- **Website TypeScript Compilation**: Fixed a `Cannot find namespace 'React'` TypeScript compiler error in `www/src/App.tsx` by adding the React namespace import.
- **macOS Window Margins**: Adjusted macOS window margins and eliminated stacked paddings that were causing visual misalignment.

- **Refactored Workspace Patches**: Modularized the workspaces codebase and refactored core workspace preference structures.

### Fixed
- **Privileged Scheme Protection**: Fixed container retargeting issues by preventing navigation to privileged browser schemes (e.g. `about:config`, `chrome://...`).
